Welcome to SCOOP's documentation!
=================================

SCOOP (Scalable COncurrent Operations in Python) is a distributed task
module allowing concurrent parallel programming on various environments,
including grids and supercomputers.

It offers simple and easy parallelization paradigms based on the `futures`
module see :pep:`3148`.

You may want to run your distributed and parallel tasks over a tightly 
integrated grid such as a supercomputer or you may want to test a bunch of 
computers laying there in the laboratory or put to good use some heterogeneous 
systems at home. SCOOP allows you to scale your parallel tasks to all these 
situations with minor modifications to your source code.
