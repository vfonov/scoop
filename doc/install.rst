Requirements
------------

The software requirements for SCOOP are as follows:

* `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ >= 2.6 or >= 3.2
* `Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_ >= 0.6.2
* `Greenlet <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet>`_ >= 0.3.4
* `pyzmq <http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:python>`_ and 
  `libzmq <http://www.zeromq.org/>`_ >= 2.2.0
* :program:`ssh` for remote execution

Installation
------------
    
To install SCOOP and its other dependencies, use 
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ as such::

    pip install scoop

.. note::
    
    If you are using Windows, you may want to install pyzmq using the installer
    available at their 
    `download page <https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/downloads>`_.
    This installer installs libzmq alongside pyzmq.

Remote usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
Because remote host connection needs to be done without a prompt, you must use 
ssh keys to allow **passwordless authentication between every computing node**.
You should make sure that your public ssh key is contained in the ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` 
file on the remote systems (Refer to the `ssh manual <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh>`_). If you have a shared :file:`/home/` over your systems, 
you can do as such::
    
    [~]$ mkdir ~/.ssh; cd ~/.ssh
    [.ssh]$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
    [.ssh]$ cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys
    [.ssh]$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh ; chmod 600 ./id_dsa ; chmod 644 ./id_dsa.pub ./authorized_keys
    
.. note::

    If your remote hosts needs special configuration (non-default port, some 
    specified username, etc.), you should do it in your ssh client 
    configuration file (by default ``~/.ssh/config``).
