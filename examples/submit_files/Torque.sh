# Path to your executable. For example, if you extracted SCOOP to $HOME/downloads/scoop
cd $HOME/downloads/scoop/examples

# Add any addition to your environment variables like PATH. For example, if your local python installation is in $HOME/python
export PATH=$HOME/python/bin:$PATH

# If, instead, you are using the python offered by the system, you can stipulate it's library path via PYTHONPATH
#export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/wanted/path/lib/python+version/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
# Or use VirtualEnv via virtualenvwrapper here:
#workon yourenvironment

# Launch SCOOP using the hosts
python -m scoop -vv fullTree.py
